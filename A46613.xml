            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am very ſorry that you ſhould Print ſuch a Scurrilous Paper againſt me, becauſe I never did you any Injury in Thought, Word, or Deed, and it ſeems to be Unkind (you being a <hi>Printer</hi>) for I have always had a Tender Regard for <hi>Printers</hi> (for my Husbands ſake) but now you well Reward me; but if you can Abuſe the King and His Government, and Sir <hi>Roger</hi> (who hath lately been ſo Kind to you) well may you (for your Intereſt) <hi>Lampoon</hi> upon me; but I'll ſpare you for this time, for the World knows what a great Enemy you have been to the King and Kingdom, and tho you have ſuffered for it, yet I find you are not changed, but is as Malicious againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as ever. The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> boaſt, That they would not Abuſe me in any Thing, for all I have Printed ſo many Papers againſt them: I muſt needs ſay, The moſt part of them hath been very Civil; therefore you are Worſe than they: Tho the Innocent Diſſenters thinks that none of their Party would be guilty of any ſuch Thing, as to Abuſe me; they are much deceived, for I am very well ſatisfied it was a Diſſenter; but however, I accept of their Excuſe: <hi>I</hi> will not Think Amiſs of thoſe that are Innocent for the Guilty; for if they do well, they will be accepted, and for the Spiteful and Malicious, they ſhall he Rewarded accordingly; for God is Juſt, and will give to every one according to their Deſerts.</p>
            <p>And for the Author, he ſays, <hi>The Sons of his Church are out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> What is your Church? It is not the Church of <hi>England</hi> that you own; therefore all that you ſay is Truth; for there was no Prince in the World could ever pleaſe you: for it is impoſſible that ſuch as you can be pleas'd; for Magiſtrates may know where they begin, but they ſhall never know where to end: And if my Words hath operated upon you, ſurely it is a great Wonder (for it was more than all the Wiſe Men in the Kingdom could do) for your Hearts are ſo Envious againſt Kingly Authority, that you can neither Thank God nor the King for any thing that you do receive: For your Ambition is ſo great, that nothing but a Throne will Content you; ſo that it is not <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience</hi> will ſatisfie you, and therefore <hi>You would Remove Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, that you might come into Government your ſelves,</hi> and ſo you may ſhake hands with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for you can make Reflections upon the Spirit. And as for the Church, She needs no <hi>God-mother,</hi> for She is under the Protection of the Moſt High: And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51146:2"/>for my <hi>Faſting, it was not to Devour Widows houſes:</hi> And as for your <hi>Reflection on the Clergy:</hi> It is the common Policy of the Devil, for he always Shoots at the Greateſt Champions. You ſay, <hi>Our Church is the only Church for Loyalty,</hi> and ſo it is, and there is none but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Vipers that ſays to the contrary. <hi>You talk of my Lightneſs,</hi> but I never was ſo Light as to Diſhonour my Husband, or Defile my Bed; and in this Excellent Qualification, I may Weigh all ſuch as you Down. You ſay, <hi>We are Good Subjects and Admirers of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as long as we are Pleas'd:</hi> And ſo We are; and when were we out of Humour, ſo as to deny our Loyalty, or the Intereſt of our Prince? And who can lay Rebellion to our Charge? And as for <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> who hath ſo much deſpiſed it as you? For your Party did condemn the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for a Fooliſh Church, becauſe She Taught <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance.</hi> You ſay, <hi>It is boldneſs in me to Condemn your Loyalty.</hi> I do not queſtion, but there is Innocent Souls amongſt you, that I do not ſpeak too, but it is ſuch Snakes and Vipers as you, that would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Intereſt of all Chriſtianity: But ſince you are are ſo Angry, Pray tell me in what your Loyalty conſiſts; is it in plucking down Churches, and Deſtroying of Loyalty under the Notion of Popery? But now I ſee you are for Promoting it; for you are beholding to them for giving you Authority to Print your Paper; and ſo you are oblig'd to Gratifie them with ſome Good Services. Therefore ſuch as you are the <hi>Diſturbers of Government, Deſtructive to Princes, by Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them to the People, filling them full of Fears and Jealouſies,</hi> and for that Cauſe the Laws were made for ſuch as you; and I think it is enough that you have <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and not to have the King Gratifie you with His <hi>Laws:</hi> Are you ſo Fearful that you cannot Truſt His Majeſty? Is your Deeds ſo Evil, that you are afraid of the <hi>Laws?</hi> Surely I thought you would have Liv'd ſo Holy now, that no <hi>Law</hi> could touch you; but I ſee you have your Old Nature upon you, that nothing will Oblige you: <hi>And as for the death of Three thouſand Perſons;</hi> what is that to the Deſtruction of Three Kingdoms and the beſt of Princes? But the Deſtruction of thoſe ſhall lie at the Doors of them that Perverted them: And if God was pleas'd to call you into the Boſome of His Church, that His Houſe might be full, you had no Reaſon to Reſiſt it, for it was not to Pray to Sticks not Stones, but to come to God through the Merits of Chriſt, without which, none can be Sav'd. Therefore there is none but bad Men that will be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and I count them Enemies to the King and Kingdom tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So I would intreat you to be Quiet, and keep your Addreſſes unto your ſelf, and let me alone, for I do not Love to be Diſturb'd with Controverſies, but Wiſh you the <hi>Grace of Repentance.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>YOu ſay, <hi>It is no Matter who you are,</hi> and you ſay, <hi>You are an</hi> Engliſh Man; Is that any Argument that you are a Good Man? Who was it that Diſturb'd Three Kingdoms and Deſtroy'd the Beſt of Princes? Were they not <hi>Engliſh?</hi> You ſay, <hi>You are Obliged to this Countrey, and the Laws hath made you Free;</hi> but it is a clear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, for you are in Bondage and Darkneſs, and are afraid of the Light, and therefore your Intentions are Evil; for if your Deſigns were Good, you need not be Aſhamed to put your Name to the Book, and then we ſhould have known who this Singular Friend was; but I find you are a Subtle Adverſary, that would Wound us, and none ſhould know it; and I ſee you have more Policy than Honeſty: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Conſiderations ſignifies nothing; <hi>and we will not be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſuch Hypocritical Canters as you are,</hi> for you Quote the Scripture for your own Ends, as the Devil did to my Bleſſed Saviour, when He was an Hungry, as to <hi>command the Stones to be made Bread,</hi> and then he would <hi>Believe he was the Son of God;</hi> but Chriſt did not ſatisfie the Devil, neither (I hope in God) will the King or the Church you: What Aileth you, that you are ſo Diſturb'd? If you do Well, what Law can Hurt you? But I find you are a <hi>Great Thief,</hi> and intends to Steal, and therefore you would have the Doors ſet open, than it might be counted no Robbery. I know your Deſigns well enough, and what you Aim at, and though you may Deceive others with your fair Pretences, yet (I hope in God) you ſhall not Deceive me. I know you can make your Self like an Angel, with Specious Pretences to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Innocent, and you know the way very well, for you are highly Guilty of ſuch Crimes; and I find you are an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51146:3"/>Goliah,</hi> for I have found you a Deceiver, for you told me, You would be a Friend to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and give Her the Right Hand of Fellowſhip; but yet the Lord Deliver Her, for none hath Deluded the Churches Children ſo much as you; for you are like the Devil to Tempt thoſe that go to the Temple, but it was no more than what he did, when he Tempted my Bleſſed Saviour, and ſaid unto Him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written, he ſhall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> See what ſweet Words the Devil can uſe for his own Purpoſe; Can Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> or any Mortal out-do him? And yet Satan knew at the ſame time, that if Chriſt had yielded, He could not have been the Son of God, for it would have deſtroyed His Intentions; for if He had yielded Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, how could He have Conquered him? Therefore pray reſt Contented, and let the Church of <hi>England</hi> alone, for She meddles with none of you firſt, but 'till you provoke Her; but you think to Rend and Tear Her, and ſet up your ſelves by it; for it is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you aim at, and that is the Principle that moves you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as you ſay) <hi>You regard not Times nor Faſhions, it is neither Thinking nor Talking,</hi> but you would fain come into Action, to fling down the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> that <hi>You may come into Government, and fling down others to ſet up Your Selves, and to be Members in Parliament,</hi> then we ſhall have Fine Doings; but (I hope in God) it ſhall never come to that. <hi>But for your Three ſorts of People that will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Concern'd in this Queſtion,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>of England, the</hi> Roman Catholicks, <hi>and the</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters. As for the Church She doth not fear the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> nor Diſtruſt Her Prince, for She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do no Ill Thing, but to Fear God and Honour the King: And as for <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> they would be very diſingenious if they ſhould doubt the Kings Fidelity: And the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> ſeems to be very well pleaſed, and is Contented, and ſays, They will not miſimploy His Majeſties Favour, but hopes they ſhall do Good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Time that is paſt; and indeed if they do as they ſay, I ſhall be very much their Friend, for I am a Lover of Peace and Unity, and deſires that all ſhould do Well, and you may aſſure your ſelf, they will never be for the Abrogating of the <hi>Teſt;</hi> for it was them of their own Nature that did it, and for the honour of them they will never diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul it? for you muſt not think to Fool them, as you do us. Therefore I would have you Study to be Quiet, and do not Deceive the People by your fair Pretences; for have you not declar'd to the World, That you are an Innocent, Harmleſs People, and did not concern your ſelves with any thing of Government more or leſs? But I find you to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51146:4"/>be great Liars, and Vipers and Snakes, that would deſtroy the whole. And what have you to do with the Whole Body of the Kingdom? We are not to yield Obedience to you: You ſay, <hi>If it appears to be their Duty, Principles, and Intereſt, the Queſtion is gain'd:</hi> Ay, that is true, but ſtay till that is made out; for I am ſure it is not their Duty, Principle, nor Intereſt, and therefore the Queſtion is loſt, and you your ſelf Miſtaken: And for your <hi>Great Inclination to ſerve them all,</hi> there is none deſires it, and therefore their Good Nature cannot plead your Excuſe. You ſay, <hi>You are neither mov'd by Hopes nor Fears, private Loſs nor Gain:</hi> But who ſhall believe you, for you have been a great Enemy for theſe ſeveral Years, and nothing will content you but our Ruin. And ſince <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not content you without taking away the <hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> it makes me to think that you have ſome Deſign under-hand more than the World knows of: Therefore I count you a Perſon not fit to be Truſted, for the King hath been to Gracious, that He hath given <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> Freely: But you ſay, <hi>The Penals Laws hinder you from coming into Action:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Laws</hi> muſt be taken away to Humour you! Yes: For what Cauſe? That the King ſhould leſſen Himſelf for you: And if you will not Truſt His Majeſty with the <hi>Laws,</hi> why ſhould the King truſt you With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them? If you do Well, there is no Law can Hurt you, but if you do Ill, why ſhould not the King and the Church have Power to Help themſelves? For They are not to be Divided, no more than a Man ſhould be from his Wife: For the King is to Defend the Church, and to keep all in Peace, and therefore you are Miſtaken, it was not the Church that Compell'd you, but it was the Civil Magiſtrate, for the Peace of the Kingdom, thinking it was the beſt way to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Government: For they did not Force Conſcience, when His Majeſty gave Liberty to Four or Five to Exerciſe, but when that would not do, but ſaid, They wanted a Prince and Governour whom they could Truſt, I think it was high Time for the late King to look about Him; and for that which happened, you may Thank your ſelves, for you have been the ſole Cauſe of it: For do you think that it would have been Reaſonable for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when the late King deſired Her Aſſiſtance, that She ſhould have refuſed it? No, no, ſuch Treachery doth not Lodge in Her Breaſt; and therefore She needs not Repent of what She hath done, for She hath done no more than Her Duty. You ſay, <hi>No Man ought to be depriv'd of his Native Right:</hi> And who doth is? For ſome Complained, That the Government <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51146:4"/>them, but it was you that refus'd it, becauſe you would not have the Trouble and the Charge: Therefore She doth not (as you ſay) deprive you of any <hi>Station in Government:</hi> and you cannot condemn Her for being Careful, for you your ſelf would do the ſame; for if you were to Entertain any one at your Houſe, and was to Truſt them with your Treaſure, would you not queſtion him whether he would be True and Honeſt, and if he ſhould not ſatisfie you, would you think him a fit Perſon to be Truſted? And why ſhould not the Church have the ſame Power to queſtion them that comes into Her Government? Is not the Peace of a Kingdom of greater Conſequence than that of a Private Family? And Therefore do not Complain ſo much againſt Her, for God hath given Her Power, and (thro Him) She will be ſo Wiſe as to keep it: For hath not God Re-eſtabliſh'd Her by a Miracle? Can any deny, but that it was an Extraordinary Providence to Reſtore my late Sovereign to His Crown and Dignities, without Spilling of Blood; and do you think that we are ſo Ungrateful as to forget ſuch Wonderful Deliverances? No, no, it is our Reſolution to Truſt God with all things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to be Wheadled out of our Senſes by <hi>Quakers</hi> or <hi>Ranters,</hi> or any other: You talk of <hi>Gods Will, Faith, Conſcience, Religion, Chriſtianity, Principles of Love, the Evidence of Truth, with its Light, which ſilenc'd the Oracles of the Heathens:</hi> But what ſignifies theſe Good Words when it is to Bad Purpoſes? And as for the <hi>Power of the deſpiſed Croſs,</hi> I don't allow that you ſhould meddle with that; for it was not the Wooden Croſs that Chriſt Exhorted His Diſciples to bear, for He could not carry that Himſelf, but it was to bear ſuch Evil Spirits as you with Patience, that Deſpiſes Him, and counts Wholeſome Counſel Madneſs, and imputes the Power of God to the Devil, and to call His Bleſſed Spouſe, <hi>The Whore of Babylon,</hi> and his Saints <hi>Anti-chriſtians:</hi> And when Chriſt ſays, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe all Things as if you uſed them not,</hi> you contradict it, and make as if the Creature was Damn'd if they go in Gay Cloathing, when (God knows) you are Prouder in your Plain Dreſs than ſome are in their Silks and Satoins. O! ye Hippocritical Devils, <hi>That ſtrain at a Knat, and ſwallow a Camel.</hi> You know Chriſt hath commanded his Diſciples to Baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſly do you diſdain both? Therefore I cannot count you Real Chriſtians as long as you do ſo; but that you are deluded by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for you ſhow his Pride to the World, and you think none walks by the Spirit but you, and I believe he was of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51146:5"/>the ſame Nature; therefore the Heavens could not contain him: and where will you be hurried when God is Angry? I pity your condition: I deſire you to beg of God to give you Humility and Repentance, that you may Mend for the time to come. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not delight in the Deſtruction of Her Enemies; but deſires that all might be Convinc'd and Converted, that they might be Happy, which beſpeaks Her to be a True Church; for Chriſts Church muſt have His Nature, or elſe ſhe cannot be His: You ſay, <hi>Chriſt Settled not his Religion in Worldly Empires:</hi> Pray where was it then? Or what did He come from Heaven for? Was it not to Save His Church that was almoſt loſt, and to Plant His Religion in the World, and to reſtore Man to that Felicity he had loſt, and to Reveal ſuch Secrets that had been hid from the Beginning of the World, and to Adopt us to cry <hi>Abba Father?</hi> So I find it was Chriſts Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that God ſhould be all in all. And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> departed this World, He did not leave His <hi>Church</hi> Deſtitute, but ſent his Holy Spirit to Subdue her Enemies, by whoſe Power Kingdoms were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;</hi> and for the Building of his <hi>Church,</hi> he choſe plain and honeſt Men, that had ſo much of the Innocency of the Dove, that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little of the Subtleneſs of the Serpent; or elſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> would never have Exhorted them, <hi>That they ſhould be as Wiſe as Serpents, and as Innocent as Doves.</hi> But I find you have more of the Subtleneſs of the Serpent, than the Innocency of the Dove: Therefore you are not Qualified for a Diſciple: You ſpeak of St. <hi>John's</hi> Love, and <hi>Chriſts Obedience to his Fathers Will;</hi> but what ſignifies that to you, when you are fill'd full of Anger-and Miſchief, and are Diſobedient and Rebellious. Indeed I have been told, <hi>That you were Subtle Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers,</hi> but I would not believe it; but when I came to ſpeak to your <hi>Great Dons,</hi> I found <hi>I</hi> was Deceiv'd! Tho <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but there are Thouſands of <hi>Innocent Souls;</hi> but it is not You, Mr. <hi>Penn. I</hi> am told, <hi>You are at</hi> Briſtol, <hi>very Buſie about Parliament Members!</hi> But if they be <hi>ſuch as you, to Abrogate the Laws,</hi> they ſhall not Proſper, for Gods Hand is againſt you. <hi>I know the Devil will Riſe in you,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> value him not, for Gods Power is above you all, and you muſt ſubmit to it. You told me, <hi>You were a Father;</hi> but what did you beget, Evil Spirits? You think to Deceive, but <hi>I</hi> hope your Deceit is at an end, <hi>for the People begins to ſee your Cloven Foot;</hi> therefore <hi>I</hi> would Adviſe you to go to <hi>Pennſilvania, for they are in a Diſtracted Condition for want of you;</hi> for indeed it was very unkind for you to Entice them <hi>out of their own Countrey,</hi> and to leave them Deſtitute. O! <hi>I would not be in your Condition for a Kingdom.</hi>
